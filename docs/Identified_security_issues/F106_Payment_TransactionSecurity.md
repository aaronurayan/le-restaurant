| **Main Security Concerns** | - **Insecure Data Transmission**: Sensitive payment details (e.g., credit card numbers, customer information) being intercepted during transit between the client, backend, and payment gateway (Man-in-the-Middle attack).<br>- **Duplicate Transactions**: A user accidentally or maliciously submitting the same payment request multiple times, leading to multiple charges for a single order.<br>- **Transactional Integrity**: The system failing mid-transaction, leading to an inconsistent state (e.g., payment is processed, but the order status is not updated). |
| **Security Measures Implemented** | - **HTTPS/TLS Enforcement**: All API communication is mandated to be over HTTPS, which is enforced at the infrastructure level (e.g., Azure App Service). This encrypts all data in transit.<br>- **Transactional Services**: The `PaymentService` methods that process payments and update order statuses are annotated with `@Transactional`. This ensures that all database operations within the method either complete successfully or are fully rolled back, preventing inconsistent states.<br>- **Idempotent API Design (Conceptual)**: The payment creation endpoint is designed to be idempotent. If the same payment request for a specific order is received more than once, the system checks if a payment already exists for that order and prevents a duplicate transaction from being created. |
| **Relevant Non-Functional or Design Requirements (if applicable)** | - **NFR-SEC-03: Payment Security**: "All payment transactions must be processed over a secure, encrypted channel. The system must prevent duplicate charges."<br>- **NFR-PERF-02: Transactional Integrity**: "All business-critical operations, especially order and payment processing, must be atomic and maintain data consistency." |
| **Impact on Overall Security** | These measures are fundamental to building trust with users and protecting the business from financial discrepancies. Encrypting data in transit protects sensitive financial information, while transactional integrity ensures that the system's financial records are reliable and consistent. This directly prevents data leakage and financial loss. |
