| **Main Security Concerns** | - **Invalid Data Submission**: A manager submitting a form with invalid data (e.g., a malformed email address, an empty name, or an invalid user role), which could corrupt the database or cause application errors.<br>- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A malicious manager could inject scripts into user data fields (like name or address), which might be executed in another user's or administrator's browser.<br>- **Data Tampering**: Modifying data in transit to bypass client-side validation. |
| **Security Measures Implemented** | - **Server-Side Validation with DTOs**: All incoming data for user creation or updates is mapped to a Data Transfer Object (DTO), such as `UserUpdateRequestDto`. This DTO uses Jakarta Bean Validation annotations (`@Email`, `@NotEmpty`, `@Size`) to enforce strict validation rules on the server side.<br>- **Exception Handling**: If validation fails, a `MethodArgumentNotValidException` is caught, and a clear `400 Bad Request` response is returned to the client, preventing the invalid data from reaching the service layer.<br>- **Principle of Least Data Exposure**: DTOs are used for API responses (`UserDto`), ensuring that sensitive fields (like password hashes) are never exposed to the client. |
| **Relevant Non-Functional or Design Requirements (if applicable)** | - **NFR-DATA-01: Data Validation**: "All user-provided input must be validated on the server side to ensure its integrity and format."<br>- **DEF-API-03: DTO Usage**: "Data Transfer Objects must be used for all API request and response bodies to decouple the API from the internal data model." |
| **Impact on Overall Security** | By enforcing strict server-side validation, the application maintains a high level of data integrity and protects against data corruption and injection attacks. This ensures that the user database remains consistent and reliable, which is fundamental for the correct functioning of authentication and other user-dependent features. |
