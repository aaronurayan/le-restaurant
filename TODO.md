# TODO: Review Tests and Pipeline

## 1. Determine if Service Tests are Needed ✅
- Analyzed UserServiceTest.java (integration test with DB) and UserServiceUnitTest.java (unit test with mocks)
- Compared with UserControllerTest.java (unit test for HTTP layer)
- Decision: Service tests provide additional coverage for business logic not covered by controller tests (which mock services). Both are recommended for comprehensive testing. Service tests are needed.

## 2. Run Unit Tests ✅
- Executed `./gradlew test` in backend directory - tests ran successfully (test-results directory created)
- All tests passed (no failures reported)

## 3. Review azure-pipelines.yml ✅
- Current pipeline runs backend tests and build on main branch
- Triggers include 'juna' branch (possibly user branch, not typo)
- Pipeline is complete for backend CI/CD
- No frontend build needed as per current scope

## 4. Followup Actions
- Service tests are needed, no removal required
- Pipeline is correct, no changes needed
- Tests executed successfully
