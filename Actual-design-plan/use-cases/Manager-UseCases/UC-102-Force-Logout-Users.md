# Use Case UC-102: Force Logout Users for Security

## Use Case Information
- **Use Case ID**: UC-102
- **Use Case Name**: Force Logout Users for Security
- **Related User Story**: FR-102
- **Actor**: Manager
- **System**: Le Restaurant Management System
- **Date Created**: 2025-01-27
- **Version**: 1.0

---

## Use Case Description
**Brief Description**: Manager can forcibly terminate user sessions for security reasons, such as compromised accounts, policy violations, or emergency security protocols.

**Primary Actor**: Manager
**Secondary Actors**: System Session Manager, Security Logger, Notification Service
**Stakeholders**: 
- Manager: Needs ability to protect system security
- Affected Users: Need to be notified of forced logout
- System Security: Maintains integrity and prevents unauthorized access

---

## Preconditions
- Manager must be authenticated with administrative privileges
- Target user must have active session(s)
- System session management must be operational
- Security logging system must be available

---

## Postconditions
**Success Postconditions**:
- Target user session(s) are immediately terminated
- User is logged out from all devices/browsers
- Security action is logged with full audit trail
- User receives notification of forced logout
- System security is maintained

**Failure Postconditions**:
- User sessions remain active if termination fails
- Security incident is logged for investigation
- Manager is notified of failure

---

## Main Success Scenario (Basic Flow)
1. Manager navigates to Security Management dashboard
2. System displays current active user sessions
3. Manager searches for specific user or browses session list
4. System displays user session details:
   - User identification (name, email, ID)
   - Session start time and duration
   - IP address and device information
   - Current activity status
   - Number of active sessions
5. Manager selects target user for forced logout
6. System displays user's active sessions with details
7. Manager selects sessions to terminate (single or multiple)
8. Manager provides reason for forced logout:
   - Security breach suspected
   - Policy violation
   - Administrative requirement
   - Emergency security protocol
9. System prompts for confirmation with warning message
10. Manager confirms forced logout action
11. System immediately terminates selected sessions:
    - Invalidates session tokens
    - Clears session data from server
    - Marks sessions as forcibly terminated
12. System sends notification to affected user:
    - Email notification with reason
    - In-app notification (if applicable)
13. System logs security action with full details
14. System displays confirmation to manager
15. Manager can optionally add additional security measures:
    - Temporarily suspend account
    - Require password reset on next login
    - Flag account for monitoring

## Alternative Flows

### Alternative Flow A1: Emergency Mass Logout
**Trigger**: Step 3 - Security emergency requires mass logout
1. Manager selects "Emergency Mass Logout" option
2. System displays all active sessions grouped by user type
3. Manager selects user groups or all users
4. Manager provides emergency reason
5. System prompts for emergency confirmation
6. Manager provides additional authentication (password/2FA)
7. System terminates all selected sessions simultaneously
8. System sends mass notifications
9. System logs emergency action

### Alternative Flow A2: Scheduled Logout
**Trigger**: Step 10 - Manager wants to schedule logout
1. Manager selects "Schedule Logout" option
2. System displays scheduling interface
3. Manager sets logout time and date
4. System confirms scheduled action
5. System executes logout at scheduled time
6. Normal notification and logging processes follow

## Exception Flows

### Exception E1: Session Already Terminated
**Trigger**: Step 11 - Target session no longer exists
1. System detects session is already terminated
2. System displays message: "Session already terminated or expired"
3. System updates display to remove terminated session
4. Manager can continue with other active sessions

### Exception E2: User Notification Failure
**Trigger**: Step 12 - Email/notification service unavailable
1. System successfully terminates session
2. System fails to send user notification
3. System logs notification failure
4. System displays warning to manager
5. Manager can manually contact user if needed

### Exception E3: Insufficient Privileges
**Trigger**: Step 1 - Manager lacks security privileges
1. System checks manager security permissions
2. System displays error: "Insufficient privileges for security operations"
3. System logs unauthorized access attempt
4. Use case terminates

## Special Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: All forced logout actions must be logged with full audit trail (NFR-105)
- **Performance**: Session termination must occur within 30 seconds (NFR-201)
- **Reliability**: System must ensure session termination even if user is offline (NFR-501)
- **Usability**: Interface must clearly indicate security implications (NFR-402)

### Business Rules
- BR-201: Only managers with security privileges can force logout users
- BR-202: All forced logouts must include documented reason
- BR-203: Users must be notified of forced logout within 5 minutes
- BR-204: Emergency mass logout requires additional authentication
- BR-205: Forced logout actions cannot be undone

## Technology and Data Variations
**Input Data**: 
- Manager authentication and security credentials
- Target user identification
- Session selection criteria
- Reason for forced logout
- Optional scheduling information

**Output Data**:
- Session termination confirmations
- User notifications (email/in-app)
- Security audit logs
- Manager confirmation messages

---

## Frequency of Occurrence
- **Normal Usage**: 1-5 times per week for security incidents
- **Emergency Usage**: Rare, during security breaches
- **Estimated Volume**: 10-20 operations per month

---

## Assumptions
- Manager understands security implications of forced logout
- Users have valid contact information for notifications
- Session management system can handle concurrent terminations
- Network connectivity allows for real-time session termination
